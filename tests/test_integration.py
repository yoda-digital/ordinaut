"""
Comprehensive Integration Tests for Ordinaut.

Tests complete end-to-end workflows including:
- Task creation through API to database to scheduler
- Scheduler triggering work items in queue
- Workers processing tasks through pipeline engine
- Real database transactions and concurrency
- Cross-component communication and data flow
- Production-like scenarios with failure recovery

Uses real containers and services to test actual integration points.
