# Ordinaut - Professional Task Scheduling Backend

## Project Mission
Build **Ordinaut**, an enterprise-grade task scheduling API with RRULE support, pipeline execution, and comprehensive observability. Designed as a **pure task scheduler** foundation that provides clean APIs for extension development. MCP integration and external tool support will be implemented as separate extensions that communicate with the core scheduler.

## Core Architecture Vision
**(1) Durable Store (PostgreSQL)** → **(2) Scheduler (APScheduler)** → **(3) Event Spine (Redis Streams)** → **(4) Pipeline Executor** → **(5) Extension API Boundary**

This creates a reliable, persistent task execution system with a clean extension architecture. The core system handles timing, persistence, concurrency, and pipeline processing while extensions (MCP servers, tool integrations, web GUIs) communicate with the scheduler through well-defined REST APIs.

## Development Environment Setup

### Python Virtual Environment (Required)
```bash
# Virtual environment is located at .venv/ (with dot prefix)
source .venv/bin/activate

# If creating new environment:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (using requirements.txt)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**IMPORTANT: The project uses `.venv/` (with dot prefix) not `venv/`. Always activate with `source .venv/bin/activate` for development and testing.**

---

## Git Commit Standards & Semantic Release

**CRITICAL: NEVER include Claude or AI authorship attribution in git commit messages.**

- NO "Generated with Claude Code" footers
- NO "Co-Authored-By: Claude" attributions  
- NO AI-related signatures or credits
- Keep commits clean and professional
- Focus on technical changes, not authorship

### Conventional Commits for Automated Releases

### Proactive Synchronization Protocol

To prevent push rejections and merge conflicts caused by a stale local state, the following workflow is **mandatory** before pushing changes:

1.  **Stash Local Changes (If Necessary):** If the working directory is dirty, stash any uncommitted changes (`git stash`).
2.  **Pull with Rebase:** Always execute `git pull --rebase origin main` to fetch and apply remote changes *before* attempting a push. This ensures the local branch is perfectly synchronized with the remote.
3.  **Pop Stash (If Necessary):** Re-apply stashed changes (`git stash pop`).
4.  **Push Changes:** Proceed with the `git push origin main` command.

This "pull-before-push" discipline is non-negotiable and guarantees a clean, conflict-free contribution history.

**The project uses Python Semantic Release for automated versioning and releases.** All commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Commit Types & Version Impact:**
- `feat:` → **Minor release** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) - New features
- `fix:` → **Patch release** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) - Bug fixes  
- `perf:` → **Patch release** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) - Performance improvements
- `feat!:` → **Major release** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) - Breaking changes
- `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `test:` → **No release**

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(api): add task snoozing functionality
fix(scheduler): resolve DST transition handling  
perf(worker): optimize SKIP LOCKED query performance
feat!: remove support for legacy API endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: Legacy v1 endpoints removed. Migrate to v2 API.
```

**Scopes:** Use module names (`api`, `engine`, `scheduler`, `workers`, `docs`, `ci`)

**Release Process:**
1. Push conventional commits to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically analyzes commits
3. Semantic-release calculates next version
4. Creates git tag, GitHub release, and updates changelog
5. All module versions synchronized automatically

---

## Development Philosophy & Standards

### Concurrency-First Design
- **ALL** job processing uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for safe distribution
- **NO** work item is ever processed twice under normal conditions
- **ALL** external operations are idempotent and safely retryable
- **ALL** database operations are ACID-compliant with proper rollback procedures

### Security by Design
- **API-based authorization** - extensions authenticate via JWT tokens
- **Input validation** at API boundary with detailed error messages
- **Audit logging** for all operations with immutable event trails
- **Rate limiting** and extension access control

### Reliability Standards
- **>99.9% uptime** - system handles all failure scenarios gracefully
- **Zero work loss** - all scheduled work persists across restarts and failures  
- **Predictable performance** - consistent response times under varying load
- **Complete observability** - metrics, logs, and traces for all operations

### Quality Gates (Non-Negotiable)
- **>95% test coverage** with unit, integration, and chaos engineering tests
- **Zero security vulnerabilities** in production deployment
- **All examples work** without modification in documentation
- **Performance SLAs met** on first implementation

## Claude Code Development Subagent System

### Development Subagent Configuration
The Ordinaut project uses **development subagents** for specialized **implementation tasks**. These subagents are **development specialists** that help **build the Ordinaut system**. Subagents are configured as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in `.claude/agents/` directory.

### How Development Subagents Work
- **Development Focus**: Each subagent specializes in **building specific parts** of the Ordinaut
- **Automatic Delegation**: Claude Code automatically selects appropriate development subagents based on implementation task context
- **Explicit Invocation**: Use `"Use the [agent-name] subagent to..."` for specific development tasks
- **File References**: Use `@filename` or `@path/to/file` to include source code and specs in development commands
- **Specialized Context**: Each subagent operates with its own context window focused on their development domain
- **Tool Access**: Development agents have specific tool permissions for coding, testing, and deployment tasks

### Available Specialist Agents (10 configured)

#### Currently Configured Development Agents (in .claude/agents/)
- **codebase-analyzer** - Analyzes project structure and implements architectural patterns for the task scheduling system
- **database-architect** - Implements PostgreSQL schema, migrations, and SKIP LOCKED job queues for reliable task execution
- **worker-system-specialist** - Builds distributed job processing and concurrency control systems  
- **api-craftsman** - Implements FastAPI endpoints and REST APIs for the task scheduling service
- **scheduler-genius** - Builds APScheduler integration and temporal logic for complex recurring schedules
- **mcp-protocol-expert** - Develops MCP extension servers that integrate with the core scheduler
- **rrule-wizard** - Implements RFC-5545 RRULE processing and calendar mathematics systems
- **observability-oracle** - Builds monitoring, metrics, logging, and alerting systems
- **testing-architect** - Creates comprehensive test suites and quality assurance systems
- **documentation-master** - Writes technical documentation, API docs, and developer guides

#### Additional Development Agents (not yet configured)
These development agents can be added to `.claude/agents/` as needed:
- **pipeline-perfectionist** - Implements deterministic pipeline execution and template rendering systems
- **security-guardian** - Builds authentication, authorization, and validation systems
- **performance-optimizer** - Implements profiling, benchmarking, and performance optimization systems
- **devops-engineer** - Creates production deployment, containerization, and operational systems

### Subagent Management
```bash
# View and manage subagents (Claude Code CLI command)
/agents

# Subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:
# .claude/agents/agent-name.md

# Use @-mentions to reference files in development commands:
"Use the database-architect subagent to implement the schema defined in @migrations/version_0001.sql"
"Use the api-craftsman subagent to build REST endpoints based on @plan.md specifications"
```

### Example Subagent Configuration
```markdown
---
name: database-architect
description: PostgreSQL expert specializing in schema design, migrations, SKIP LOCKED patterns, query optimization, and concurrent access patterns. Masters ACID properties and data integrity for high-performance applications.
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
---

You are a senior database architect with deep PostgreSQL expertise...
```

### Optimal Development Workflow

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)
```python
# Claude Code automatically delegates to specialized development subagents
# These agents BUILD the Ordinaut system:

# Implement project structure and architecture
"Use the codebase-analyzer subagent to implement the project structure based on @plan.md specifications"

# Build database schema and migrations
"Use the database-architect subagent to implement PostgreSQL schema with SKIP LOCKED patterns from @plan.md"

# Implement FastAPI application structure
"Use the api-craftsman subagent to build the FastAPI service structure and basic endpoints from @plan.md"

# Or let Claude auto-delegate development tasks
"Implement the database schema"  # Auto-uses database-architect to BUILD schema
"Create the API endpoints"       # Auto-uses api-craftsman to BUILD endpoints
```

#### Phase 2: Core Systems (Days 2-3)
```python
# Sequential implementation with specialized development subagents

# Build scheduler system
"Use the scheduler-genius subagent to implement APScheduler service with PostgreSQL job store"

# Build worker coordination system
"Use the worker-system-specialist subagent to implement SKIP LOCKED job processing workers"

# Implement pipeline execution engine
"Use the pipeline-perfectionist subagent to build the deterministic execution engine with tool simulation"

# Build integration tests
"Use the testing-architect subagent to implement comprehensive test suites for all core systems"
```

#### Phase 3: Quality & Production (Continuous)
```python
# Every component gets built with quality and production readiness:

# Build security systems (when security-guardian is configured)
"Use the security-guardian subagent to implement authentication and authorization systems"

# Build performance monitoring (when performance-optimizer is configured)  
"Use the performance-optimizer subagent to implement profiling and optimization systems"

# Build observability systems
"Use the observability-oracle subagent to implement monitoring, logging, and alerting systems"

# Build deployment systems
"Use the devops-engineer subagent to implement Docker containerization and deployment automation"
```

### Agent Coordination Principles

#### 1. Context Preservation
**ALWAYS** pass relevant context between agents:
```python
context = {
    "architectural_decisions": previous_agent_outputs,
    "performance_requirements": {"latency": "<200ms", "throughput": "1000 tasks/min"},
    "security_constraints": ["scope_validation", "audit_logging", "input_sanitization"],
    "database_schema": schema_from_db_architect,
    "api_contracts": contracts_from_api_craftsman
}
```

#### 2. Validation Chains
Critical components require multi-agent review:
```python
# Security-critical components
implementation → security-guardian → testing-architect → documentation-master

# Performance-critical components  
implementation → performance-optimizer → testing-architect → observability-oracle
```

#### 3. Parallel Development
Independent components can be developed simultaneously:
- Database schema + API design + Worker system (parallel)
- Security implementation + Performance optimization + Testing (parallel)
- Documentation + Deployment + Observability (parallel)

## Critical Implementation Patterns

### Database Access Pattern (REQUIRED)
```python
# ALWAYS use SKIP LOCKED for job queues with SQLAlchemy 2.0 text() wrapper
from sqlalchemy import text

def lease_work():
    with db.begin() as tx:
        work = tx.execute(text("""
            SELECT id, task_id, payload
            FROM due_work 
            WHERE run_at <= now() 
              AND (locked_until IS NULL OR locked_until < now())
            ORDER BY priority DESC, run_at ASC
            FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
            LIMIT 1
        """)).fetchone()
        # ... update with lease timeout
```

### RRULE Processing Pattern (REQUIRED)
```python
# ALWAYS handle timezone edge cases
from dateutil.rrule import rrule, rrulestr
import pytz

def get_next_occurrence(rrule_string: str, timezone_name: str) -> datetime:
    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone_name)
    rule = rrulestr(rrule_string)
    # Handle DST transitions gracefully
    next_occurrence = rule.after(datetime.now(tz), inc=False)
    return tz.localize(next_occurrence) if next_occurrence else None
```

### Pipeline Execution Pattern (CURRENT STATE)
```python
# Core system simulates tool execution - real tools implemented as extensions
from engine.executor import run_pipeline

def execute_task_pipeline(task):
    # Pipeline executor processes structure and simulates tool calls
    result = run_pipeline(task)
    
    # Result contains:
    # - Template-resolved arguments: ${steps.x.y}, ${params.z}
    # - Simulated tool execution results
    # - Complete execution context for extensions
    
    return result
```

### Error Handling Pattern (REQUIRED)
```python
# ALWAYS implement exponential backoff with jitter
import random

def exponential_backoff(attempt: int, base_delay: float = 1.0, max_delay: float = 300.0):
    delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** (attempt - 1)), max_delay)
    jitter = delay * (0.5 + random.random() * 0.5)  # 50-100% of delay
    return jitter
```

## Example Pipelines (Production Ready)

### Morning Briefing Pipeline (Template Structure)
```json
{
  "title": "Weekday Morning Briefing",
  "schedule_kind": "rrule",
  "schedule_expr": "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYHOUR=8;BYMINUTE=30",
  "timezone": "Europe/Chisinau",
  "payload": {
    "pipeline": [
      {"id": "calendar", "uses": "google-calendar-mcp.list_events", "with": {"start": "${now}", "end": "${now+24h}"}, "save_as": "events"},
      {"id": "weather", "uses": "weather-mcp.forecast", "with": {"city": "Chisinau"}, "save_as": "weather"},
      {"id": "emails", "uses": "imap-mcp.top_unread", "with": {"count": 5}, "save_as": "inbox"},
      {"id": "brief", "uses": "llm.plan", "with": {"instruction": "Create morning briefing", "calendar": "${steps.events}", "weather": "${steps.weather}", "emails": "${steps.inbox}"}, "save_as": "summary"},
      {"id": "notify", "uses": "telegram-mcp.send_message", "with": {"chat_id": 12345, "text": "${steps.summary.text}"}}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note**: This pipeline structure is processed by the core scheduler, with tool execution simulated. MCP extensions will implement the actual tool integrations (google-calendar-mcp, weather-mcp, etc.) that communicate with the scheduler via REST APIs.

---

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Schedule not triggering**: Check timezone settings and RRULE syntax
- **Worker not processing**: Verify SKIP LOCKED query and database connections
- **Template errors**: Validate JMESPath expressions and variable names
- **Pipeline simulation**: All tool calls are currently simulated - extensions will handle real execution

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# View active tasks
