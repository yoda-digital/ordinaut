## üö¶ Quick Start

### Development Mode
```bash
cd ops/
./start.sh dev
```

### Production Mode  
```bash
cd ops/
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values
./start.sh prod
```

### Using Makefile
```bash
make dev          # Start development
make prod         # Start production
make logs         # Follow logs
make status       # Check status
make scale-worker # Scale to 4 workers
make clean        # Clean up
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
All services support comprehensive environment configuration:
- Database and Redis connection strings
- Logging levels and formats
- Resource limits and timeouts
- Timezone and locale settings
- Security and authentication options

### Service Dependencies
Proper dependency chains ensure services start in correct order:
- PostgreSQL and Redis start first
- API, Scheduler, Worker wait for database health
- Health checks ensure service readiness

### Network Architecture
- Custom bridge network for service isolation
- Internal service discovery via DNS
- External access only to necessary ports
- Security through network segmentation

## üìä Production Features

### Resource Management
- CPU and memory limits for all services
- Resource reservations for guaranteed performance
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Performance monitoring integration

### High Availability
- Multiple API replicas for load distribution  
- Worker scaling for throughput requirements
- Database persistence and backup procedures
- Service restart policies and health recovery

### Security
- Non-root container execution
- Minimal attack surface with slim images
- Network isolation between services
- Security scanning integration

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoints for load balancers
- Structured logging for log aggregation
- Resource usage monitoring
- Application-specific metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Operations

### Deployment
```bash
# Single command deployment
./start.sh prod --build

# With resource monitoring
make prod && make watch
```

### Scaling
```bash
# Scale workers for high throughput
docker compose up -d --scale worker=6

# Scale API for high availability  
docker compose up -d --scale api=3
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Service status
make status

# Live logs
make logs

# Health checks
./healthcheck.sh --verbose
```

### Backup & Recovery
```bash
# Database backup
make db-backup

# Full system backup  
make volume-backup

# Disaster recovery
make db-restore FILE=backup.sql
```

## üîç Integration Points

### Existing Codebase Integration
- Uses `requirements.txt` for exact dependency versions
- Integrates with `api/main.py` FastAPI application
- Supports `scheduler/tick.py` APScheduler service
- Connects `workers/runner.py` job processors
- Applies `migrations/version_0001.sql` schema automatically

### External Integration
- Standard PostgreSQL and Redis endpoints
- RESTful API on port 8080
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Standard Docker networking
- Compatible with Kubernetes deployment

## ‚ú® Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Command Deployment**: `docker compose up` starts the entire stack
2. **Production Ready**: Resource limits, security, monitoring built-in
3. **Developer Friendly**: Hot reloading, debug mode, easy operations  
4. **Horizontally Scalable**: Workers and API can scale independently
5. **Data Safe**: Persistent volumes, backup procedures, ACID compliance
6. **Observable**: Health checks, logging, metrics, status monitoring
7. **Secure**: Non-root execution, network isolation, minimal attack surface

The Personal Agent Orchestrator can now be deployed with a single `docker compose up` command, providing a complete, production-ready AI agent coordination platform with bulletproof scheduling, reliable execution, and comprehensive observability.
