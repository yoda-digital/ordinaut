## 🔍 Known Limitations & Recommendations

### Integration Testing Dependencies
**Issue:** Some integration tests require Docker containers  
**Impact:** 🟡 Medium - Affects CI/CD pipeline  
**Recommendation:** Use testcontainers or mock services for CI

### Pydantic V2 Migration
**Issue:** Deprecation warnings for V1 validators  
**Impact:** 🟡 Low - Functional but with warnings  
**Recommendation:** Migrate to V2 field_validator decorators

### Production Database
**Issue:** Tests currently use SQLite for unit tests  
**Impact:** 🟡 Low - PostgreSQL features need integration testing  
**Recommendation:** Use PostgreSQL test containers
