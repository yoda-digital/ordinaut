# API Reference

The Ordinaut REST API is the primary interface for all interactions with the task scheduling system. It is built with FastAPI, which provides automatic, interactive documentation.

## Interactive Documentation

While this reference provides a comprehensive overview, you can also use the interactive documentation generated by the API itself:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs)
- **ReDoc:** [http://localhost:8080/redoc](http://localhost:8080/redoc)

These interfaces allow you to explore and test every endpoint directly from your browser.

## Base URL

- **Development:** `http://localhost:8080`
- **Production:** `https://api.your-domain.com/v1`

## Common Concepts

### Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Error responses follow a consistent JSON format, as defined by the `ErrorResponse` schema:

```json
{
  "error": "ValidationError",
  "message": "Invalid schedule expression",
  "details": {
    "field": "schedule_expr",
    "value": "invalid cron",
    "expected": "Valid cron expression (e.g., '0 9 * * 1-5')"
  },
  "request_id": "req-123456789",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-10T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Rate Limiting

To ensure system stability, the API enforces rate limits. By default, this is based on the client's IP address. If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Check the `Retry-After` header to know when you can send another request.

The response body will also contain details:

```json
{
  "error": "RateLimitExceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests",
  "details": {
    "limit": "60/minute"
  },
  "retry_after": 45
}
```
