## Why Ordinaut

### The Problem: Disconnected AI Agents
Modern organizations rely on multiple AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, local LLMs) that operate in isolation:
- **No shared memory** - agents can't coordinate or build on previous work
- **No temporal awareness** - cannot schedule future actions or maintain ongoing processes
- **No reliability guarantees** - work gets lost, duplicated, or abandoned
- **No observability** - black box operations with no monitoring or debugging capabilities

### The Solution: Orchestrated Agent Coordination
Ordinaut creates a **shared backbone** that transforms individual agents into a coordinated system:

```json
{
  "title": "Daily Executive Briefing",
  "schedule": "FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=7;BYMINUTE=30",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "pipeline": [
    {
      "id": "gather_metrics",
      "uses": "analytics.business_metrics", 
      "with": {"lookback_days": 1, "include_forecast": true},
      "save_as": "metrics"
    },
    {
      "id": "analyze_trends",
      "uses": "llm.analyze",
      "with": {
        "data": "${steps.metrics}",
        "focus": "revenue, costs, team_productivity, customer_satisfaction"
      },
      "save_as": "analysis"
    },
    {
      "id": "generate_briefing",
      "uses": "llm.executive_summary",
      "with": {
        "analysis": "${steps.analysis}",
        "format": "executive_briefing",
        "max_length": 500
      },
      "save_as": "briefing"
    },
    {
      "id": "deliver_briefing",
      "uses": "communication.send_executive_summary",
      "with": {
        "recipients": ["cto@company.com", "ceo@company.com"],
        "subject": "Daily Executive Briefing - ${date}",
        "content": "${steps.briefing.summary}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** Automatic daily executive briefings combining business metrics, trend analysis, and strategic insights - delivered consistently every morning at 7:30 AM with zero manual intervention.

FROM due_work 
WHERE run_at <= now() 
  AND (locked_until IS NULL OR locked_until < now())
ORDER BY priority DESC, run_at ASC
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
LIMIT 1
```

**Security-First Design:**
