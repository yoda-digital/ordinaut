# Pipelines & Tools

Ordinaut's power comes from its declarative pipeline engine, which executes a series of steps in a predictable and reliable way.

## Pipeline Structure

A pipeline is a JSON array of **steps** defined in the `payload` of a Task. The engine processes these steps in order, passing context between them.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "params": { "city": "Chisinau" },
    "pipeline": [
      {
        "id": "get_weather",
        "uses": "weather-api.get_forecast",
        "with": {"location": "${params.city}"},
        "save_as": "weather"
      },
      {
        "id": "send_alert",
        "uses": "telegram.send_message",
        "if": "steps.weather.temperature > 25",
        "with": {
          "message": "It's hot today: ${steps.weather.temperature}Â°C"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Key Step Properties

- `id`: A unique identifier for the step within the pipeline.
- `uses`: The address of the **Tool** to be executed (e.g., `weather-api.get_forecast`).
- `with`: An object containing the arguments for the tool. This section supports template variables.
- `save_as`: The key under which the step's output will be saved in the context. This allows subsequent steps to use the result (e.g., `steps.weather`).
- `if`: A conditional [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) expression. If it evaluates to a "falsy" value (like `false`, `null`, `[]`, `{}`), the step is skipped.
- `timeout_seconds`: An optional timeout for the tool call (default is 30 seconds).
- `max_retries`: An optional number of times to retry this specific step if it fails.

## Template Variables

You can dynamically insert data into the `with` block using template variables, which are resolved using JMESPath expressions against the current context.

- **`${params.variable_name}`**: Accesses parameters defined in the `payload.params` section of the task.
- **`${steps.step_id.output_field}`**: Accesses the output of a previous step that used `save_as`. You can traverse nested JSON objects (e.g., `${steps.weather.details.humidity}`).
- **`${now}`**: A special variable that provides the current UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format.

## Tool Execution (Simulated)

Tools are the building blocks of pipelines, representing a specific capability like sending an email. However, it is critical to understand that the core Ordinaut engine **simulates** tool execution.

!!! warning "Tools are Not Executed by the Core Engine"
    When the pipeline executor encounters a step with a `uses` field, it performs the following actions:
    1.  It renders the input templates in the `with` block.
    2.  It logs that a tool call is being **simulated**.
    3.  It generates a mock output object containing the tool address and the rendered input.
    4.  If `save_as` is present, it saves this mock output to the context for subsequent steps.

    The engine **does not** have a tool catalog, nor does it validate input/output schemas or execute any external code for the tool. The actual implementation of tools must be built as **separate extension services** that are triggered by events from Ordinaut or that poll the Ordinaut API.

## Error Handling

If a step fails (e.g., due to a template rendering error), the engine will respect the `max_retries` policy defined on the task or the step itself. If all retries fail, the entire pipeline run is marked as `failed`, and the error details are recorded in the **Run** object.
