## Outstanding Items (Pre-Production)

### 🔴 **Critical (Must Fix Before Production)**
1. **JWT Secret Configuration**
   - Current: Uses default dev secret key
   - Required: Set secure random 256-bit key
   - Command: `export JWT_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"`

2. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Current: Authenticates by agent ID only
   - Required: Implement proper credential verification
   - Timeline: 1-2 days

### ⚠️ **Important (Should Fix)**
1. **Test Coverage Improvement**
   - Current: 11% actual coverage
   - Target: 80%+ for critical modules
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Configure production CORS settings
   - Add agent credential storage schema
   - Timeline: 3-5 days

### 💡 **Nice to Have (Can Fix After Launch)**
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Database query optimization
   - Response caching
   - Connection pool tuning

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Advanced monitoring dashboards
   - Automated capacity scaling
   - Enhanced error reporting
